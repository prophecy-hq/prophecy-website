## A health record system that is helping improve population-wide hypertension control in India, Bangladesh and Ethiopia.

Simple helps manage hypertensive patients by tracking their blood pressure and medications and ensuring, through regular check-ups, that patients stay on treatment.

Hypertension is asymptomatic and a “silent killer.” 90% of the 200 million hypertensive adults in India are not on regular treatment. As part of the India Hypertension Control Initiative (IHCI) and Resolve to Save Lives (RTSL), the programme aims to improve hypertension control by 25% by the year 2025, in order to drastically reduce heart attacks and strokes, which kill millions of Indians.

#### Our challenge was to make Simple

- Easy to learn an use for busy clinicians to help them record hundreds of patients everyday
- Intuitive for first time smartphone users
- Offline first to work in areas with poor internet connectivity and on low-end devices

#### Outcomes

- Used in over 2,500 public health facilities in India, Bangladesh and Ethiopia. Gradually rolling out nation-wide in India.
- ~700,000 patients enrolled with over 2.6 million blood pressures recorded
- 18 sec — median time to record a follow-up visit
- 65 sec — median time to register a new patient in Simple

#### Deep immersion through field research

Continuous user research in remote villages of Punjab and Maharashtra gave us an intimate understanding of the challenges faced by clinicians. They each saw over a hundred patients a day and relied mostly on hard-to-maintain paper records. Moreover, every clinic had its own workflows, which we had to accommodate.

#### Realistic, data-rich prototyping

We tested over 20 prototypes with over 200 clinicians over the course of the project. Our prototypes ranged from simple click-throughs to React based Framer ones to a React Native app that could very accurately simulate real-world scenarios. This extensive and iterative testing enabled us to rapidly learn and refine Simple.

#### Finding the right patient

Most patients enrolled in the programme didn’t carry any forms of ID, didn’t remember their entire phone number and didn’t know their precise age. There were many patients of the same name and it was very hard for clinicians to find the right patient in the app. This could potentially lead to mismatched data entry and duplicate records.

In our research, we found that most patients remembered at least the last few digits of their phone number and the date they had last visited the clinic. We devised a search field where clinicians could find patients by either their name or part of their phone number. The date of their last visit was prominently displayed to further confirm their selection.

#### Driving behaviour change through BP Passports

To make search completely error free, we created printed patient ID cards that have a unique ID and a QR code on them, which could be scanned at any location. These “BP Passports” present to patients a clear long-term record of their past BPs, unlike prescription slips, which are easily lost.

BP Passports were designed to look and feel nice in the hand. Patients appreciated this and felt like they were getting entitled to something of value. We observed that patients became more regular and took their hypertension more seriously after receiving their BP Passports.

#### Ensuring patients follow-up and remain on treatment

We created an “Overdue” tab which displays patients who miss their scheduled visit. Those who are at greater risk are moved at the top of the list. Clinicians can call these patients to remind them to visit for a follow up. SMS and WhatsApp reminders are also sent out patients automatically.

We designed an intuitive way to mark the result of each call through three buttons that follow the traffic-light metaphor: green if the patient has agreed to visit, yellow if connecting with them was unsuccessful and the clinician would like to try again later, and red if the patient needs to be removed from the list.

#### Extremely intuitive

In our tests, even established design conventions were not understood by our users, who were first-time smartphone users. With Simple, we were able to create an inclusive “high-tech” solution doesn’t assume any prior experience with technology.

Simple was designed not for users to interact with it, but to mediate clinicians’ interactions with each other. We carefully studied existing clinical workflows and the ways in which doctors and nurses collaborate. While we were designing, we simulated in our studio clinics and hospitals of different sizes, and many possible patient scenarios to create a system that adapts and then gets out of the users’ way.
