## A social, fun exam preparation app that brings good coaching to students living in tier 2 and tier 3 cities.

On Gradeup, students can take curated courses, take quizzes, post and answer questions, stay motivated to study regularly, and compare their predicted rank with thousands of other students.

#### Our challenge was to redesign Gradeup to

- Create a first-time user experience that wouldn’t overwhelm
- Make regular study habit-forming and fun
- Create a clear study plan for every student
- Present students with a clear sense of where they stand
- Better leverage the power of social interactions

#### Outcomes

- Between 2018 and 2019, Gradeup went from 1M to 15M users, which helped them raise a $7M Series A round
- Over 2.5M monthly active users
- Users are active for 32 minutes daily on average

### Highlights

#### Milestone-based learning

During our research, we talked with students and observed how they studied — what kept them going and what impeded their progress. We realised that they needed goals that were neither too too hard and nor too unchallenging.

Previously, new content on different subjects was posted ad-hoc, which worked well to keep existing users engaged, but lacked structure. Students weren’t chasing a definite goal and struggled to stay motivated. We designed study plans with bite-sized sessions, which could each be completed in one sitting. Each session contained text, videos and a graded quiz. With regular study, students would unlock progressively harder milestones, and greater rewards. This ensured that there was always an achievable next-goal in sight.

#### Multi-tracked courses

Every student’s needs are different — while some of them are looking to go deep over months, others are looking for a quick revision plan. We designed the course structure with these two tracks in mind. The complete course is a 250 lesson plan that is fully comprehensive, while the revision track has only 30 lessons that can be covered quickly in the final leg of one’s exam preparation.

#### Evaluation, insights and predictions

Effective study requires both study and evaluation. We overhauled the quiz taking experience to present students with clear, actionable insights into what they could do to improve — their rolling speed and accuracy, and topics to study again. With all the students in a course taking the same quizzes, we were able to continuously rank each student against thousands of others. This gave them a realistic sense of how they would rank in the actual exam.

#### Habit-forming through gamification

We introduced the ability to set a daily goal for the number of lessons the student aims to take. Maintaining a streak gets them rewarded with points and achievement badges, which can be be seen by their friends. We also added an in-app store where points could be exchanged Gradeup branded merchandise.

#### Getting unstuck, quickly

Getting stuck on a thorny problem can be very demotivating, especially during self-study. While students could already post questions on Gradeup, they would often go unanswered for too long. To get them answers to their questions faster and to reward those posting the answers, we designed a bounty system where the student posting the question could spend some of their points to set a reward for the quickest right answer.

#### A virtual classroom for competition and camaraderie

Students can connect with their friends on the Gradeup to see their progress, comment on their posts and answer their questions. A leaderboard keeps the competition alive, while the social feed encourages a spirit of helpfulness.

With this redesign, we were able to create a virtual super-classroom experience for students who couldn’t physically access a coaching centre. We are glad to have been part of this ed-tech revolution that is helping level the playing field for everyone.
