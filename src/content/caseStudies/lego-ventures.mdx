## A series of experiments with LEGO's investment arm to figure out a viable, feasible, and desirable solution for depression and lack of fitness in children.

The challenge was to take a vague idea, find out if there was a need and a market for it and validate the right idea to build, all in 2 months in the cheapest way possible.

I worked alongside 3 members from the LEGO Ventures team for this project.

The process we undertook involved using design experiments to prove or disapprove early and organically emerging hypotheses. This scientific approach helped tackle the riskiest assumptions at each step.

### Major hypotheses that were tested

---

#### Hypothesis 1: This is a "hair on fire" problem

**The problem:** 4.5m children have diagnosed anxiety, and 1.9m have diagnosed depression in the US alone (2018). Children diagnosed with anxiety or depression (6-17) increased from 5.4% in 2003 to 8.4% in 2012(Center for Disease Control and Prevention)

#### Making smallcase discovery easier.

To validate this, we conducted:

1. Desk research to understand how the problem has been growing and evolving;
2. Interviews with child mental and physical wellbeing experts to understand their perspective and experience on the subject; and
3. A survey (n=250) for parents to understand if they believe the problem to be significant or not.

**Result:** The survey came in with, and 94% would use it with other apps or completely replace others. 89% think it is unique and innovative.

			'Insights from initial user interviews and expert interviews. There seemed to be a clear indication of a need for this problem, and an ideal solution would have to be playful,interactive and family-oriented.',
		],
	]}
/>

#### Hypothesis 2: We can find a potential solution that is fun, useful and unique.

1. We spoke to parents and experts to explore what solutions and characteristics might best address their needs. The solution needed to be **playful, family-oriented, and interactive.**(Quotes from the interviews are in the images above)
2. Using this as our starting point, we stitched together six quick concepts, narrowed them down with the help of experts, further detailed one of these concepts using video, and finally tested it with a survey (n=450) of parents. Testing it on such a large scale with parents provided some amazing results!
3. The chosen concept employed two-way fun, guided and interactive family yoga, all core characteristics identified through research earlier in the project.

These findings were extremely validating, but we didn't stop there. Identifying desirability through a survey, although positive, needed to be backed with stronger data points.

To do this, we ran **3 different sets of Facebook ads, each linked** to a **different landing page.** This was done to gauge interest, track how many people would sign up for early access, and identify what kind of messaging worked best.

**Expectations:** The benchmark click-through rates in the tech category were 1.04%, and email opt-ins were 2-5% across all industries. Our goal was set at 10-15% for email opt-ins. This would serve as a good indicator of success.

**Result:** It was a **resounding success** and further confirmed our hypothesis. Click-through rates were over 3x our expectations, and email opt-in was 3x higher than our goals and 5x the industry standard!

		],
  ]}
/>

#### Hypothesis 3: The solution is feasible

From our research, iteration and testing, it became clear why this solution should exist in the world. However, it was important to determine how feasible the solution would be to build and produce— especially considering the core concept was dependent on advanced camera tech.

**Result:** We prototyped the core tech in a few days to prove it was indeed feasible.

	]}
/>

### Outcomes

- In 2 months, we gained clarity on the problem and what a potentially desirable, viable, and feasible solution could be. All without building anything out! Just by using designing in experiments.
- Every experiment underwent several iterations. Failing fast is the name of the game, showing how it's possible and extremely resourceful for any idea to be validated, evaluated and improved upon— early, cheap and quickly.
